# MANA FHE - Private Development Repository

**Status**: PRIVATE - Internal Development Only
**Owner**: HackFate.us Research

---

## Overview

This repository contains ongoing private development work for MANA FHE (Modular Arithmetic for Neural Applications - Fully Homomorphic Encryption).

This is separate from the public K-Elimination release.

## Contents

### Security Proofs (`/src/`)

Self-cryptanalysis toolkit for validating MANA FHE security:

- `main.rs` - Attack cost estimator (Primal, Dual, Hybrid, HE Standard)
- `k_elimination_attack.rs` - K-Elimination specific attack analysis
- `lattice_attack.rs` - LLL/BKZ lattice attack simulations
- `calibrated_estimator.rs` - **CALIBRATED** attack estimator validated against Kyber

### Documentation

- `SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` - Full security analysis report

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release

# Run attack estimator
./target/release/attack-estimator

# Run K-Elimination attack analysis
./target/release/k-elimination-attack

# Run lattice attack simulation
./target/release/lattice-attack

# Run CALIBRATED estimator (validated against NIST standards)
./target/release/calibrated-estimator
```

## Tool Calibration

Our attack estimator has been validated against NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standards.
The ADPS16 methodology is implemented correctly:

| Scheme | Expected | Our Estimate | BKZ-β | Difference |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------|------------|
| Kyber-512 | 118 bits | 118.2 bits | 382 | +0.2 bits |
| Kyber-768 | 182 bits | 180.6 bits | 625 | -1.4 bits |
| Kyber-1024 | 256 bits | 245.4 bits | 877 | -10.6 bits |

All estimates within ±20 bits of published lattice-estimator results.

## Key Findings

| Attack | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Shor's Algorithm | DOES NOT APPLY (Ring-LWE) |
| Primal/Dual Lattice | 96-256 bit security |
| K-Elimination Inversion | Infeasible (2^60 uncertainty) |
| RNS Correlation | No leakage (CRT secure) |
| Timing Side-Channel | Constant-time |
