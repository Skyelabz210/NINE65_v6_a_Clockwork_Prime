//! QMNF Exact Transcendentals Engine
//!
//! INNOVATION: Transcendental functions computed with ZERO floating point operations.
//! All algorithms use only: add, subtract, multiply, shift, and K-Elimination division.
//!
//! ## Algorithms Implemented:
//! 1. **CORDIC** - Shift-and-add for sin/cos/tan/atan/sinh/cosh/exp/log
//! 2. **Integer Newton-Raphson** - Exact sqrt with rational convergents  
//! 3. **AGM** - Arithmetic-Geometric Mean for log/π with quadratic convergence
//! 4. **Binary Splitting** - Hypergeometric series for exp/sin/cos/π
//! 5. **Continued Fractions** - Exact rational approximations
//!
//! ## Key QMNF Integrations:
//! - K-Elimination for all divisions (100% exact)
//! - CRTBigInt for arbitrary precision
//! - Montgomery persistence for multiplication chains
//! - Shadow Entropy for any randomization needs
//!
//! Performance targets:
//! - 64-bit precision: <100ns per operation
//! - Arbitrary precision: O(M(n) log n) where M(n) is multiplication time
